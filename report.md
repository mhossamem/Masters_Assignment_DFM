### Assignment Report 

## Problems faced : 

* Problem 1 :

Finding resources on certain specific scenarios proved to be difficult. You would have to choose between different resources and nitpick which resources you should use and which were deemed unnecessary. Solutions were not as provisional as possible.

* Problem 2 : 

There were many ways to optimize the solution in which some were faster in certain scenarios of reads while another way was faster in writes.
Ultimately, you have to choose between them.

* Problem 3 : 

There were many ways to do the steps in the assignment for example in choosing the model for the sql database you can use sqlite3 or mysqlconnect package and that was another dilemma of having to choose. Eventually, I went with sqlite3 because it is more suitable for smaller databases as it is faster.

Overall, I think that the assignment held true to it's difficulty in providing problems and had a good blend of personal freedom to choose between the tools and being definite about an endgoal.

## Data visualization

I would choose a multi-line data visualization for this assignment and have it show different labels and colors for each station as well as a different line visualization for each reading. I would also use a horizontal bar chart to compare between the most NO producing areas. The tools I would likely use are tableau or google charts.

## Learning Outcomes

I've definitely developed a lot of abilities following this assignment such as utilizing python scripts alongside databases. I would like to give thanks to the course providers aswell because it was easier to understand something that is more taught in an interesting and an enthusiastic way than it is to understand something that is simply not taught with enthusiasm.
